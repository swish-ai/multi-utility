These three times coincide with entries in the exchange server logs showing you lost connection at those same times. The VPN policy is to time out a connection if it hasn't been active in 30 minutes. Please ensure the next time you lose connectivity you are still connected to the VPN.\n\nI'm going to update this incident to resolved. Please let me know if you need any more assistance.","2016-12-13 18:42:25","1c741bd70b2322007518478d83673af3","158fba37cc40000001","12","incident","david.loo","JOURNAL FIELD ADDITION","david.loo"
