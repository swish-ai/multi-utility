Oggetto: AW: Password notreal - please very urgent request

Dear Someone2,

Due to audit/security reasons, we (meaning the team behind group mailbox  aaa@bbb.com : aaa@bbb.com ) are not in charge (or allowed) for setting/resetting passwords directly in notreal TEST, but only for unlocking the appropriate user accounts directly in the system.

By now I`ve checked in notreal TEST and for John Snow the appropriate user account (notid) is in place and the role ABAC_PIC_UNIT is properly assigned (for data uploads/adjustments of RC12345):

[cid: aaa@bbb.com 

There is also an appropriate user account (notid2) in place for Tywin someone3 notmatter4, having also the proper role ABAC_PIC_UNIT assigned, but with extensive rights (for all reporting entities instead only for the one (RC12345) he should be in charge for):
[cid: aaa@bbb.com 

This is caused by the fact that when requesting the appropriate notreal authorization via JBNNB, there hasn`t been specified the specific reporting entity for the appropriate role of the user (see below), therefore (after the request has been approved by the line manager (first step) and the responsible colleagues from GAR (second step)), it has been processed by JBNNB accordingly for all reporting entities:

[cid: aaa@bbb.com 

Due to audit/security reasons this is not allowed for notreal TEST, so for the time being I have locked the appropriate user in notreal TEST:
[cid: aaa@bbb.com 

But nevertheless, since the remaining time to the upcoming Q4/12345 notreal RSR reporting is very short (cluster opening is planned for 12345/01/28 eob), exceptionally for this time I have generated by myself a new request (see below) for the above mentioned user account via JBNNB, hoping that it will be approved very soon (today??) and we will get the correct notreal authorization generated via JBNNB and transferred automatically via batch to our notreal TEST system:

[cid: aaa@bbb.com 

[cid: aaa@bbb.com 




We will then crosscheck by tomorrow whether the correct notreal authorization has been transferred automatically from JBNNB to notreal TEST and unlock the appropriate user account again in our system.

For setting/resetting the passwords in notreal TEST our colleagues from  aaa@bbb.com : aaa@bbb.com  are in charge for, so if you would like to request an initial or new password, please contact them via  aaa@bbb.com : aaa@bbb.com  so that an appropriate incident ticket gets raised automatically on their side.

Please be aware that the logon to our notreal TEST system has to be done with user account written in capital letters and password as case sensitive.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Kind regards,

not_a_person2

Betreff: Password notreal - please very urgent request


Internal

Dear King of the North,
some days ago, the consultants who are going to support Company Viva in our first uploading of QRT’s in notreal, have requested the initial notreal’s password to the address  aaa@bbb.com : aaa@bbb.com 

Currently they don’t have received it yet.

We know that there are technical times to receive the password, but unfortunately our local IT amended technical problems to allow them to request the authorization through JBNNB only few days agò.

Now we are worried to not receive the password in time to allow them to operate in notreal (the first uploading of QRT’s should be executed starting from tomorrow).
Could you provide the notreal’s password to notmatter4 Tywin and Snow John (in cc) as soon as possible, please?

We would really appreciate it.
Thank you for all the support you can give us.
Kind Regards,
Someone2
